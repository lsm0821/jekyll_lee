My final project title: A weather visualizer

Description:
I am thinking about using weather API to do a data visualization.
This time, I am thinking about making it more artistic than before, to entertain people
who see my project and show others that I can use API to pull data that I need.

Frameworks: I am using p5js to do it, because I am more used to this at making better design for my visualization.
