Hi, this is an explanation of API visualization.

This is a link: [https://lsm0821.github.io/Prototype/](https://lsm0821.github.io/Prototype/)

I worked on using p5Js and live weather API of Nome, Alaska to visualize it.

This is a website where I got a live weather data: [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/)

A hardest part of this assignment might be coming up with an idea of how to visualize data, because I don't have
much knowledge about it yet. However, by approaching with a simple design like making a chart, I was able to make
this project look clean with necessary information.
