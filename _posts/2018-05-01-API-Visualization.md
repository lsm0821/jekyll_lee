Hi, this is my API Visualization project.

I used a weather API of Nome, Alaska for this project.

The API had data of 6 days of weather information like a max temperature, humidity, etc....

I used p5js to program this project.

To let users to use this project easier, I let scenes that I have to go to next scenes whenever the users click with a mouse.

Also I used data of wind speed to portray of a speed of wind among other days.

I simply insert an image of wind icon and make it go right with a speed of wind speed data.

This is a website where I got a live weather data: [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/)


A hardest part of this assignment might be coming up with an idea of how to visualize data, because I don't have
much knowledge about it yet.

However, by approaching with a simple design like making a chart, I was able to make
this project look clean with necessary information.
