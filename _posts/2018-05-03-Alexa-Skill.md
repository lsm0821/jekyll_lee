Hi, this is a project about working with my Alexa skill.
I made Alexa Skill about telling facts.

![congratulations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsm0821/jekyll_lee/master/image/Project/New%20folder/Screen_Shot_2018_01_19_at_2.15.47_PM.1516388236.png)

I made one for telling facts about South Korea to not let people get confused it with North Korea.

I worked on this website: [https://developer.amazon.com/alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa).

I used a lambda server to run Alexa: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1)

Under is some facts that I put for South Korea facts.

Somehow, a region must be North Virginia. - haha

This was a tutorial that I followed to make my Alexa bot:

[https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto)

It was a challenging material to learn.

However, by having many good tutorials and my professor's instruction, I was able to finish the Alexa Project.
