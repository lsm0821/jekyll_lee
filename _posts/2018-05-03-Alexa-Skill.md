Hi, this is a project about working with my Alexa skill.
I made Alexa Skill about telling facts.

I made one for telling facts about South Korea to inform people about it to prevent them confusing South Korea with North Korea.

I worked on this website: [https://developer.amazon.com/alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa).

I used a lambda server to run Alexa: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1)/

Somehow, a region must be North Virginia. - haha

This was a tutorial that I followed to make my Alexa bot: [https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto)

It was a challenging material to learn; however, by having many good tutorials and my professor's instruction guided me well.
