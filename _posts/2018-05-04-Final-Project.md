For my final project, I did a similar thing as my API visualization project.

However, this time, I used 5 live API data.

Here is my link: [https://lsm0821.github.io/Final_API/](https://lsm0821.github.io/Final_API/)

I made a screen size into Iphone 6's, because I was interested in building phone application.

I also used P5JS for this project, because it is a programming language that I feel comfortable with.

APIs that I used are from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/).

I used 5 countries' weather:
1. Seoul, Korea
2. Moscow, Russia
3. Beijing, China
4. London, England
5. Sunny Valley, United State


I was able to make bar graphs and line graphs that act according to live data.

This means that whenever weather data change, my graphs, temperatures that I wrote down, etc... will change.

Also I put a digital caster to visualize weather data to more friendly way like having a virtual weather forecaster inside your phone.

I felt good to use p5JS fluently to shape my project; however, it was a bit challenging at coming up with creative visualizations.

Since I knew I did not have enough time, I just decided to go for a simplest design that can tell readers data easily.
