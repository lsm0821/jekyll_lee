Hello, this is a twitter bot that I made.

Here is a link [https://twitter.com/Lovot0](https://twitter.com/Lovot0).

A concept of this twitter bot is "Greek God v.s. Dinosaurs."

I used an API of names off Greek God and dinosaurs to put them in a sentence structures.

For example, var tweet = data1 + " picked a " +data2+" to fight " + data3

So I could pull data from a list of Greek Gods to put one in there by randomly.
Therefore, there will be a sentence like Poseidon picked a grocery list to fight Heterosaurus.

Later, I had to do use EC2 to run my twitterbot constantly forever; however, because I was worried
if my account will get banned, I just did not run mine forever.
