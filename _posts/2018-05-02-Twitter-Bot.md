Hello, this is a twitter bot that I made.

![congrat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsm0821/jekyll_lee/master/image/Project/New%20folder/screen-shot-2015-12-03-at-22820-pmpng.png)

A concept of this twitter bot is "Greek God v.s. Dinosaurs."

I used an API of names off Greek God and dinosaurs to put them in a sentence structures.

For example, var tweet = data1 + " picked a " +data2+" to fight " + data3

So I could pull data from a list of Greek Gods to put one in there by randomly.

Example: "Poseidon picked a grocery list to fight Heterosaurus."



Later, I had to do use EC2 to run my twitter-bot constantly forever.

But, because I was worried if my account will get banned, I just did not run mine forever.
